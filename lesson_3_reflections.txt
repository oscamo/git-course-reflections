When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When I want to be able to collaborate around the repository.

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	So that I can decide when my changes amount to a state of my repository that I want to share.
